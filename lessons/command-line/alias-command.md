# alias

## Lesson Content

Sometimes typing commands can get really repetitive, or if you need to type a long command many times, it’s best to have an alias you can use for that. To create an alias for a command you simply specify an alias name and set it to the command. 

<pre>$ alias foobar=’ls -la’</pre>

Now instead of typing ls -la, you can type foobar and it will execute that command, pretty neat stuff.

You can remove aliases with the unalias command: 

<pre>$ unalias foobar</pre>

## Exercise

Create a couple of aliases then remove them.
