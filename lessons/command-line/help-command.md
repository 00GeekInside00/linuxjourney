# help

## Lesson Content

Linux has some great built-in tools to help you how to use a command or check what flags are available for a command. Each built-in shell command like ls, cat, mv, etc has a built-in helper that you see if you run help and then the command. 

<pre>$ help ls</pre>

This will give you a description and the options you can use when you want to run ls. For other executable programs, it’s convention to have an option called --help or something similar. 

<pre>$ ls --help</pre>

Not all developers who ship out executables will conform to this standard, but it’s probably your best shot to find some help on a program.
